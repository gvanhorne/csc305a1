# CSC 305 Assignment 1

This document outlines the successful implementation of the required features and components in the animation project.

## Project Requirements and Implementation

1. **Real-Time Synchronization (2 Marks)**: Animations are synchronized either to the timestamp or the difference between the current timestamp and previous.

2. **Ground Box (2 Marks)**: A ground box is created to provide a visual base for the scene.

3. **Two Rocks (4 Marks)**: Two rock spheres are placed on top of the ground box.

4. **Seaweed Modeling (4 Marks)**: Each strand of seaweed attached to the base of the rock consists of 10 elipses.

5. **Seaweed Animation (4 Marks)**: The seaweed animates according to a sin wave function with offset phase for each seaweed frond to simulate currents.

6. **Seaweed Positioning (3 Strands) (3 Marks)**: Three strands of seaweed are placed on the rock.

7. **Fish Modeling (6 Marks)**: The fish is designed with 2 eyes, a head, a body, and 2 tail fins.

8. **Fish Animation (4 Marks)**: The fish swims in a circular path around the seaweed, aligned to the tangent of a circle.

9. **Human Character Modeling (4 Marks)**: A human character with no arms is modeled in the scene.

10. **Character Movement (2 Marks)**: The character moves in the x and y world directions.

11. **Leg Animation (4 Marks)**: The character's legs kick, with hip and knee rotations, as demonstrated in the video. The feet remain static.

12. **Bubble Animation (2 Marks)**: Bubbles spawn from the character's mouth area and float upward independently.

13. **Scene Dimensions and Visual Similarity (4 Marks)**: The scene fits within the window and is visually similar to the provided samples.

14. **Programming Style (2 Marks)**: The code is well-documented with comments, and functions are appropriately organized for clarity and maintainability.
